### Chaturanga Chess

![Chronology of World Chess History](http://en.ria.ru/images/15990/76/159907607.jpg)

**The title Chaturanga Chess relates back to ancestry of the game of Chess.**

_Chaturanga and Shatranj: The precursors of chess originated in India_
_during the Gupta dynasty (c. 280 - 550 CE). Both the Persians and Arabs_
_ascribe the origins of the game of Chess to the Indians. The words for_
_"chess" in Old Persian and Arabic are “Chatrang” and “shatranj” respectively —_
_terms derived from chaturaṅga in Sanskrit, which literally means an army_
_of four divisions or four corps. Chess spread throughout the world and many_
_variants of the game soon took shape._

#### Mission Statement

Take the opportunity to learn from Chess Grand Masters with Chaturanga Chess.

With Chaturanga Chess you can move back and forward throughout a Chess match between two greats like Fischer and Spassky.

Chaturanga Chess accepts the PGN notation (discussed below) and allows you to view a step-by-step recreation of
a historical chess game.




#### Unique Ruby Gem Dependencies

[PGN - A PGN parser and FEN generator for ruby.](https://github.com/capicue/pgn)

[shoulda-matchers](https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers/blob/master/README.md#shoulda-matchers--) provides Test::Unit- and RSpec-compatible one-liners that test common Rails functionality. These tests would otherwise be much longer, more complex, and error-prone.


##### PGN & FEN
"[Portable Game Notation (PGN)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation) is a plain text computer-processible format for recording chess games (both the moves and related data), supported by many chess programs."

"PGN is structured "for easy reading and writing by human users and for easy parsing and generation by computer programs." The chess moves themselves are given in algebraic chess notation. The usual filename extension is ".pgn"."

"[Forsyth–Edwards Notation (FEN)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation) is a standard notation for describing a particular board position of a chess game. The purpose of FEN is to provide all the necessary information to restart a game from a particular position."

"FEN is an integral part of the Portable Game Notation for chess games, since FEN is used to define initial positions other than the standard one."
